# Swift Data Structures
A Swift Implementation of Basic Data Structures. I have based each class on the Java API

##Installation
To install, simply fork this project into your repo. That will insert all the files for you. If you're concerned about space, each file lists its requirements at the top, so only include the class you need and the classes it needs, and the classes they need. (I'd just take all, its not that big

##Plans
* Implement More Data Structures
* Turn these into frameworks, so users can simply import datastructures (kinda like "import Queue" etc)

##Usage
I don't require this, but it would be nice for some recognition of my code in your app's description (on iTunes) or in the app itself

##Contribution
If you'd like to add a Data Structure, first off, Thanks! Your helping Swift be awesome.

Second, make sure:
* You don't use files that I've already written. (If my version isn't comprehensive enough to include your version too, rewrite my version so I can see what you've changed
* Submit a pull request, and I'll merge your code. I'll also mention you below (if you want to) and credit you for your contribution
##IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING A BUG REPORT WITH A FIX
* Make sure you open an issue first. Provide the code in the issue (as raw) and I'll merge it, and give you credit
