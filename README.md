# Swift Data Structures
A Swift Implementation of Basic Data Structures. I have based each class on the Java API

##Installation
####Terminal
```shell
cd Path/To/Project/Where/You/See/All/Your/Files
git clone https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures
```
####Finder
Download [the zip file](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/archive/master.zip) and save it into your project folder

##Data Structures Implemented
So Far, we have

* [LinkedLists](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/blob/master/DataStructures/LinkedList.md)
* [Queues](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/blob/master/DataStructures/Queue.md)

Each structure conforms to ```SequenceType``` and ```CustomStringConvertible```, so you can use them as easily as traditional Swift structures

##Plans
* Implement More Data Structures
* Turn these into frameworks, so users can simply ```import DataStructures``` (kinda like ```import Queue``` etc)

##Usage
I don't require this, but it would be nice for some recognition of my code in your app's description (on iTunes) or in the app itself

##Contribution
If you'd like to add a Data Structure, first off, Thanks! Your helping Swift be awesome.

Second, make sure:

* You don't use files that I've already written. (If my version isn't comprehensive enough to include your version too, rewrite my version so I can see what you've changed
* Submit a pull request, and I'll merge your code. I'll also mention you below (if you want to) and credit you for your contribution

####IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING A BUG REPORT WITH A FIX
* Make sure you open an issue first. Provide the code in the issue (as raw) and I'll merge it, and give you credit
