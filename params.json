  "body": "#Data Structures Like Never Before\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n####Terminal\r\n```shell\r\ncd Path/To/Project/Where/You/See/All/Your/Files\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures\r\n```\r\n####Finder\r\nDownload [the zip file](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/archive/master.zip) and save it into your project folder\r\n\r\n##Data Structures Implemented\r\nSo Far, we have\r\n\r\n* [LinkedLists](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/blob/master/DataStructures/LinkedList.md)\r\n* [Queues](https://github.com/ronakdev/swift-datastructures/blob/master/DataStructures/Queue.md)\r\n\r\nEach structure conforms to ```SequenceType``` and ```CustomStringConvertible```, so you can use them as easily as traditional Swift structures\r\n\r\n##Plans\r\n* Implement More Data Structures\r\n* Turn these into frameworks, so users can simply ```import DataStructures``` (kinda like ```import Queue``` etc)\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nI don't require this, but it would be nice for some recognition of my code in your app's description (on iTunes) or in the app itself\r\n\r\n##Contribution\r\nIf you'd like to add a Data Structure, first off, Thanks! Your helping Swift be awesome.\r\n\r\nSecond, make sure:\r\n\r\n* You don't use files that I've already written. (If my version isn't comprehensive enough to include your version too, rewrite my version so I can see what you've changed\r\n* Submit a pull request, and I'll merge your code. I'll also mention you below (if you want to) and credit you for your contribution\r\n\r\n####IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING A BUG REPORT WITH A FIX\r\n* Make sure you open an issue first. Provide the code in the issue (as raw) and I'll merge it, and give you credit\r\n",
